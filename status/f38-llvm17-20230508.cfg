dotnet6.0: "ld.lld: error: version script assignment of 'V1.0' to symbol 'PAL_RegisterModule' failed: symbol not defined" Caused by change by behavior change in lld: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/241dbd310599e3c1a0f1b0c9ced14c8b8760539e Upstream fix: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/81573
phonon: [-Wenum-constexpr-conversion] It looks like this error was introduce by a change to a system header (maybe qt?).
libssh: [-Werror,-Wstrict-prototypes]
mesa: Some kind of dependency issue with libspriv.
python-pycurl: I can't reproduce this.  It could be a build-order issue
ImageMagick: I'm building ImageMagick outside of COPR.  I also think this may be a duplicate of https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/62668.  Let's revist this in the next testing cycle if it's still not fixed.
